# social-media-mock-page

Reflections:

1. This is my first time recreating a social media landing page (Linkedin + Facebook inspired). I tried to mock it as close as possible but also be creative. 

2. Mainly HTML and CSS. No extra references or google search for this one. Proud of myself for a simple Website. 

3. The only thing is that it is not a responsive Web design. But didn't learn Media Query yet.
